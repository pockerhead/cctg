//! Presses a key in the console of the agent's Claude Code process
//! (TASK-029): Esc, as when typed in the terminal.
//!
//! Channels have no command for it, so on Windows the agent (a child of
//! that claude) attaches to its console and writes the key events into the
//! console input: `FreeConsole` + `AttachConsole(claude pid)` + `CONIN$` +
//! `WriteConsoleInputW`, then `FreeConsole` again. A console is attached per
//! process, so one press at a time. The agent's stdio are pipes and stay
//! untouched. Elsewhere nothing is supported yet and the agent does not
//! announce the capability.
//!
//! A successful write says only that the key events are in the console
//! input buffer (behind any input that waits there), not that Claude Code
//! read them or that its turn ended.
